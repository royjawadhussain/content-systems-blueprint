# Blueprint: Content Systems That Survive Scale

This document expands the README into a practical model that can be applied inside real teams.

## 1) Decision Ownership

Define ownership for four decision classes:

- Editorial judgment: what is correct, fair, and clear
- Policy interpretation: what is allowed and what is risky
- Brand and tone: what matches the intended voice
- Business alignment: what supports priorities without distortion

Assign one named owner per class.

## 2) Risk Tiers

Create three tiers:

- Tier 1: Low risk (routine, repeatable)
- Tier 2: Medium risk (interpretation required)
- Tier 3: High risk (legal, regulatory, reputational)

Tie review depth to risk tier, not seniority preferences.

## 3) Escalation Rules

Make escalation predictable:

- What triggers escalation
- Who receives it
- How long they have to respond
- What happens if they do not respond

Time-boxed escalation protects speed and accountability.

## 4) Standards That Scale

Create standards teams can use without asking:

- Definitions and prohibited claims
- Evidence and sourcing requirements
- Disclaimers and mandated language
- Approval requirements by tier

Standards should reduce ambiguity, not create bureaucracy.

## 5) Measurement

Track signals that reveal system health:

- Rework rate and top causes
- Escalation frequency and themes
- Time-to-publish by tier
- Recurring compliance issues
- Performance by intent, not vanity metrics

Metrics exist to improve decision-making, not dashboards.
