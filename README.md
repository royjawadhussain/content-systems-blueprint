# Content Systems Blueprint

A practical framework for building content and communications systems that hold up under scale, complexity, and regulatory pressure.

This repository is curated for leaders and operators who treat content as infrastructure, not output.

---

## Core Purpose

This space holds foundational patterns around:

- Decision architecture for content systems
- Editorial governance that scales
- Operating workflows with clarity and accountability
- Measurement models that matter beyond vanity metrics

---

## Blueprint Overview

### 1) Decision Architecture
Define:
- Who owns final editorial judgment
- Who interprets policy and risk
- What requires escalation and why
- What can ship without review

### 2) Editorial Governance
Create:
- Standards that translate policy into usable rules
- Review tiers based on risk, not preference
- Time-boxed escalation paths
- A simple audit trail for key decisions

### 3) Operating Workflow
Design:
- Intake rules (what comes in, how, and when)
- Drafting and review sequence
- Final checks based on risk tier
- Post-publication feedback loops

### 4) Measurement That Matters
Track:
- Revision rate and rework causes
- Time-to-publish by risk tier
- Compliance and factual error trends
- Repeated escalation themes
- Performance by intent, not vanity metrics

---

## Who This Is For
- Regulated or high-trust organizations
- Teams scaling content across channels and regions
- Leaders who want consistency without bureaucracy
