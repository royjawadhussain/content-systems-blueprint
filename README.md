# Content Systems Blueprint

A practical framework for building content and communications systems that hold up under scale, complexity, and regulatory pressure.

This repository is intentionally lightweight and designed for decision-makers, content leaders, and communications teams.

## What this includes

- A blueprint for content systems at scale
- Decision ownership and escalation design
- Governance models that reduce risk without slowing execution
- Operating principles for consistent judgment

## Who this is for

- Regulated or high-trust organizations
- Teams scaling content across multiple channels
- Leaders who want consistency without bureaucracy

## How to use it

1. Start with the blueprint below
2. Adapt the decision model to your reality
3. Use the governance section to remove uncertainty
4. Keep changes versioned as your team grows

## The blueprint

### 1) Decision architecture
Define:
- Who owns final editorial judgment
- Who interprets policy and risk
- What requires escalation and why
- What can ship without review

### 2) Governance that scales
Create:
- Standards that translate policy into usable rules
- Review tiers based on risk, not preference
- Time-boxed escalation paths
- A simple audit trail for key decisions

### 3) Operating workflow
Design:
- Intake rules (what comes in, how, and when)
- Drafting and review sequence
- Final checks that catch high-risk issues
- Post-publication feedback loops

### 4) Measurement that matters
Track:
- Revision rate and rework causes
- Time-to-publish by risk tier
- Compliance and factual error trends
- Repeated escalation themes
- Content performance by intent, not vanity metrics

## Notes

This is a living framework. Updates are intentionally infrequent and only published when the model improves.
